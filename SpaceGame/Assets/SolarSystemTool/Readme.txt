After importing the package, a new window will be available to use in Window->Solar system tool

Known bugs!!!:

The editor game view *must* be set to the 1920x1080 aspect ratio. Otherwise most rendering functionality will break. This was only discovered 2 days in advance.
The particle occulsion culling sometimes does not work either, restarting Unity fixes this problem most of the time
When first importing an error will show, ignore that as it wont show up again
Moving a solar system from the origin postion breaks the 2D editor
Dark textures on certain Unity versions
